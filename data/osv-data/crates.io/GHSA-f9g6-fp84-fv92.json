  "summary": "impl `FromMdbValue` for bool is unsound",
  "details": "The implementation of `FromMdbValue` has several unsoundness issues. First of all, it allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a bool and could make undefined behavior happen with safe function. Secondly, it allows transmuting pointer without taking memory layout into consideration. The details of reproducing the bug are available [here](https://github.com/vhbit/lmdb-rs/issues/67).\n",
