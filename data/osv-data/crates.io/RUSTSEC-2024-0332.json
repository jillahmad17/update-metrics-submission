  "summary": "Degradation of service in h2 servers with CONTINUATION Flood",
  "details": "An attacker can send a flood of CONTINUATION frames, causing `h2` to process them indefinitely.\nThis results in an increase in CPU usage.\n\nTokio task budget helps prevent this from a complete denial-of-service, as the server can still\nrespond to legitimate requests, albeit with increased latency.\n\nMore details at \"https://seanmonstar.com/blog/hyper-http2-continuation-flood/.\n\nPatches available for 0.4.x and 0.3.x versions.",
