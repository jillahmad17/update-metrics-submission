  "summary": "olm-sys: wrapped library unmaintained, potentially vulnerable",
  "details": "After several cryptographic vulnerabilities in `libolm` were disclosed publicly, the Matrix Foundation has [officially deprecated the library](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/08/libolm-deprecation/). `olm-sys` is a thin wrapper around `libolm` and is now deprecated and potentially vulnerable in kind.\n\nUsers of `olm-sys` and its higher-level abstraction, `olm-rs`, are highly encouraged to switch to [`vodozemac`](https://crates.io/crates/vodozemac) as soon as possible. It is the successor effort to `libolm` and is written in Rust.",
