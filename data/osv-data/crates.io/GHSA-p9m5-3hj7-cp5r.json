  "details": "Affected versions of the crate used a UnsafeCell in thread-local storage to return a noop waker reference, assuming that the reference would never be returned from another thread.\n\nThis resulted in a segmentation fault crash if Waker::wake_by_ref() was called on a waker returned from another thread due to it attempting to dereference a pointer that wasn't accessible from the main thread.",
