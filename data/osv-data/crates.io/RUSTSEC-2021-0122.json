  "summary": "Generated code can read and write out of bounds in safe code",
  "details": "Code generated by flatbuffers' compiler is `unsafe` but not marked as such.\nSee https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6627 for details.\n\nFor example, if generated code is used to decode malformed or untrusted input,\nundefined behavior (and thus security vulnerabilities) is possible even without\nthe use of the `unsafe` keyword, [violating the the meaning of \"safe\"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.unsafe.html#the-different-meanings-of-unsafe) code;\n\nAll users that use generated code by `flatbuffers` compiler are recommended to:\n1. not expose flatbuffer generated code as part of their public APIs\n2. audit their code and look for any usage of `follow`, `push`, or any method that uses them\n   (e.g. `self_follow`).\n3. Carefully go through the crates' documentation to understand which \"safe\" APIs are not\n   intended to be used.",
