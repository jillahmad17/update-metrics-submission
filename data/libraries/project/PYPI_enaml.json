About Enaml ----------- Chris Colbert began the Enaml project under the umbrella of Enthought, Inc. in August 2011. The project was forked into the Nucleic project in March 2013. Chris is still the project lead.  The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic project and its subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: http://github.com/nucleic. The current team consists of:  * Chris Colbert * Matthieu Dartiailh  Previous contributors include:  * Ioannis Tziakos * Robert Kern * Corran Webster * David Wyde * Brett Patterson * Tim Diller * John Wiggins * Didrik Pinte * Deepankar Sharma * Kelsey Jordahl * Naveen Michaud-Agrawal * Steven Silvester * Mark Dickinson * Simon Jagoe * Chris Farrow * Puneeth Chaganti * Matthew Scott * Jack Minardi * Warren Weckesser * Christoph Gohlke  Our Copyright Policy -------------------- Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Nucleic repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # Copyright (c) 2013-2024, Nucleic Development Team. # # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License. # # The full license is in the file LICENSE, distributed with this software. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ",

About Enaml ----------- Chris Colbert began the Enaml project under the umbrella of Enthought, Inc. in August 2011. The project was forked into the Nucleic project in March 2013. Chris is still the project lead.  The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic project and its subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: http://github.com/nucleic. The current team consists of:  * Chris Colbert * Matthieu Dartiailh  Previous contributors include:  * Ioannis Tziakos * Robert Kern * Corran Webster * David Wyde * Brett Patterson * Tim Diller * John Wiggins * Didrik Pinte * Deepankar Sharma * Kelsey Jordahl * Naveen Michaud-Agrawal * Steven Silvester * Mark Dickinson * Simon Jagoe * Chris Farrow * Puneeth Chaganti * Matthew Scott * Jack Minardi * Warren Weckesser * Christoph Gohlke  Our Copyright Policy -------------------- Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Nucleic repositories.
