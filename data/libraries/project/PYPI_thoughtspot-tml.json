ThoughtSpot may, in its discretion, provide alternatives that reduce adverse impacts to ThoughtSpot\u2019s intellectual property or other rights.  OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS. A Tool may include one or more open source software components provided under separate license terms which can be found in the open source disclosure file provided with or within a Tool download. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, open source software is licensed to Company under such OSS\u2019s own applicable license terms, which can be found in the attribution file. The open source license terms are consistent with the license granted in this EULA, and may contain additional rights benefiting Company. The open source license terms shall take precedence over this EULA to the extent that this EULA imposes greater restrictions on Company than the applicable open source license terms. To the extent the license for any open source software requires ThoughtSpot to make available to Company the corresponding source code and/or modifications, Company may obtain a copy of the applicable source files by sending a written request, with Company\u2019s name and address to: ThoughtSpot, Inc., 910 Hermosa Court, Sunnyvale, California 94085, United States of America.

In addition to open source components, a Tool may include one or more components licensed by a third party (a \u201cComponent\u201d) (e.g., an application programming interface or a sample data set). To the extent that third-party license requirements apply to a third-party component in a Tool, such additional license terms will be provided in the open source disclosure file provided with or within a Tool download. Third-party license terms shall take precedence over this EULA to the extent that they impose additional restrictions or limitations on Company than the license provided herein for download and use of a Component. The parties agree that: (a) to the extent that the terms between Company and the third party for use of a third-party technology accessed by the Component are more restrictive, such terms shall apply to Company\u2019s use of the Component; (b) ThoughtSpot, and not the third party, is responsible for the Component including, without limitation, for any warranties, maintenance, and support thereof, and the third party does not warrant the Component\u2019s accuracy, reliability, completeness, usefulness, non-infringement, or quality of the Component, and will not be liable for any losses or damages of any kind, including lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages, relating to use of or reliance on the Component; and (c) the third party owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Component, including all intellectual property rights therein.

Company will indemnify and hold harmless ThoughtSpot from any claim made by any third party due to or arising directly or indirectly out of its conduct or any connection with its use of this Tool, violation of the terms herein, and any violation of any applicable law or regulation. ThoughtSpot reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any manner subject to indemnification by Company, but doing so will not excuse Company\u2019s indemnity obligations.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THOUGHTSPOT AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.

In addition to open source components, a Tool may include one or more components licensed by a third party (a \u201cComponent\u201d) (e.g., an application programming interface or a sample data set). To the extent that third-party license requirements apply to a third-party component in a Tool, such additional license terms will be provided in the open source disclosure file provided with or within a Tool download. Third-party license terms shall take precedence over this EULA to the extent that they impose additional restrictions or limitations on Company than the license provided herein for download and use of a Component. The parties agree that: (a) to the extent that the terms between Company and the third party for use of a third-party technology accessed by the Component are more restrictive, such terms shall apply to Company\u2019s use of the Component; (b) ThoughtSpot, and not the third party, is responsible for the Component including, without limitation, for any warranties, maintenance, and support thereof, and the third party does not warrant the Component\u2019s accuracy, reliability, completeness, usefulness, non-infringement, or quality of the Component, and will not be liable for any losses or damages of any kind, including lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages, relating to use of or reliance on the Component; and (c) the third party owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Component, including all intellectual property rights therein.

ThoughtSpot reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any manner subject to indemnification by Company, but doing so will not excuse Company\u2019s indemnity obligations.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THOUGHTSPOT AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.
