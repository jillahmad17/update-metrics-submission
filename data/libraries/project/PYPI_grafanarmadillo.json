You can include source code licensed by others under the MIT License, two-clause BSD License, BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License, Apache License Version 2.0, or similar terms that give less certainty about patents, so long as the developers of the source code don't mention that patents apply or might apply to the software in code comments, documentation, or legal notices, and you aren't aware of any such patents yourself.  3. Take these steps within thirty days.  4. Note that this license doesn't let you change the license for this software.
