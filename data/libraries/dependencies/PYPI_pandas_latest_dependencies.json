The included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.  Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is Copyright \u00a9 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or Copyright \u00a9 2003-2011 David Schultz or Copyright \u00a9 2003-2009 Steven G.

Moshier or Copyright \u00a9 2017-2018 Arm Limited and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.  The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.  The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are Copyright \u00a9 1999-2019, Arm Limited.  The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is Copyright \u00a9 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.  The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.  The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright \u00a9 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.  The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  All other files which have no copyright comments are original works produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files can be found in the git version control history of the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the interest of source tree size.  In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files without any requirement of attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:  Bobby Bingham John Spencer Nicholas J. Kain Rich Felker Richard Pennington Stefan Kristiansson Szabolcs Nagy  all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.  This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers. All rights reserved.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON ===============================================================  Python software and documentation are licensed under the Python Software Foundation License Version 2.  Starting with Python 3.8.6, examples, recipes, and other code in the documentation are dual licensed under the PSF License Version 2 and the Zero-Clause BSD license.  Some software incorporated into Python is under different licenses. The licenses are listed with code falling under that license.   PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2 --------------------------------------------  1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation (\"PSF\"), and the Individual or Organization (\"Licensee\") accessing and otherwise using this software (\"Python\") in source or binary form and its associated documentation.  2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of copyright, i.e., \"Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 Python Software Foundation; All Rights Reserved\" are retained in Python alone or in any derivative version prepared by Licensee.  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.  4.

This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers. All rights reserved.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.
